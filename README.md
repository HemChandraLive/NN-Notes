# NN-Notes

This repository will  house the entire blog for the course taught by Dr. Bapi S. Raju, SCIS, UoH

## Rubric

* Create a new branch for each sub-topic. They will later be merged into their own respective branches, Perceptron, MLFFNN, and 
SVM

* Each branch would be prefixed with your name to avoid confusions eg: `sai/hot-stuff`, here hot stuff is the brach name. You 
should let it be the the name of the topic that you are working on

* Each branch will house only a single directory. All the files must reside inside it

* All your code for drwaing a figure would reside in a separate `.py` file.

* These files created then shall be imported into the jupyter notebook. You may choose to write a single function called 
`display()`  with necessary parameters to display the figure. This way the notebook will house only the important stuff. Peeps 
can have a peek at the code if they choose so...


## Commit message format

* The commits must be in imperative mood. The best way to obtain it is like so:

Consider that you have made a commit which does the follows:

```
This commit will add the draw function
```

Your commit message will look like so:

```
Add the draw function
```

Just chuck the `This commit will` part.

* Captalise the first letter of the commit

* Do not end the subject line with a peroid
