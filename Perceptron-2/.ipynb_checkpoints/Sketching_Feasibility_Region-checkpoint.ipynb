    "## Feasible region for multiple input\n",
    "The Feasible Region is the cone or area in which the solution weight vector resides. The solution weight vector is not unique all the time, it definetly lies in the feasibility cone.It is the function of the orientation in which the input vectors are alligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can we claculate the cone of feasibility given a few input vectors?\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Every input vector has a plane (Hyper palne) which is perpendicular to the input vector and it passes through the origin. The black line in the below image is the hyper plane(A line in this case) whic divides the plane into two halves.  \n",

    "    <li>On one side of the plane the output is wrong because the scalar product of the input vector and the weight vector has wrong sign.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The scalar product of two vectors x and w is given by the below formula:\n",
    "        $ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{x.w} = \\mathbf{|x||w|\\cos\\alpha }\\end{align}$</li>\n",
    "    <li>For example let us consider an input vector whose desired output is \"1\" (the left side figure). The right side of the weight vector is determined by the sign of the Dot product or Scalar product of the weight vector and the inpupt vector. In this case if the dot product is <b>positive</b> then it is the right region else it is the wrong region of weight vector</li>\n",
    "    <li>Similarly if the desired output for input vector is \"0\" (the right side figure) then the right side of the weight vector is where the dot product sign is <b>negative</b> </li>\n",
